# space-filling-curve-intradistances
calculating and plotting the average distance from one cell to the next with various space filling curves

## plot of size (side length of square which shall be tiled) vs distance
![plot showing Gray code curves have the largest average distance while Z order curves have the smallest](./plot.png)

## examples of the curves used
*size means iterations/depth in this context, not side length*
